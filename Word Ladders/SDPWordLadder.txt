Requirments
	- Find the shortest path between two words of the same length (Example "cat" and "dog") using linked list as a ques

	- do not allow to search for different sized words if different size word is given end search there.
	
	- find shortest ladder.

understanding 
	- using a linked list as a que, my program should use the breadth first search to search a list of words and find the quickest ladder between two words.
	- program should search words around it and for each word found add it to a partial ladder que the ladders will keep increasing until the word is found.
	- program should determine how many words were read from dictionary, be able to display all the words which are one away from a given word and be able to display the contents of the 
	partial Solution list.

design 
	- iterate over letters in word and check if word is in disctionary, if word is in dicionary add the word to queue.
	- if word is found print out queue. and total enqueues.
	- if word is not in dictionary skip the word.
	- makes sure to check if word has already been used.
	
May have problems, with coding the breadth First search, may need two linked list one to be search and one to create partial ladders as a que until a ladder is complete.
